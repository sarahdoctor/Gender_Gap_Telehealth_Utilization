# Gender_Gap_Telehealth_Utilization
This project will use causal inference methods, such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation, and multivariable modeling to test whether gender-based gaps are more likely to emerge before the choice to use telehealth, men being generally less likely to seek any kind of medical care.

# Findings
Across various models, including logistic regression, propensity score matching, IPTW, and TMLE, men were generally less likely to use telehealth services compared to women. However, this effect varied by age group. For individuals under 65, men were significantly less likely to utilize telehealth, while for those 65 and older, the gender difference was much smaller and often not statistically significant.
